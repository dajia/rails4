CREATING RECORDS 

First Method

New/save (three step process)

Insatntiate object

instantiate object = create a new object from a class. This object also called instant of this Class

Second Method

Create (one step process)

Instantiate object, set values, save


FIRST METHOD
---------------------------------
Insatntiate object
----------------------------------
subject = Subject.new -> this creates a new object from Subject's Class

 #<Subject id: nil, name: nil, posistion: nil, visible: false, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil> => rails gives us the attributes that the new object subject haw inherited from the Class Subject. The columns that we set on migration create these attributes, that either they have no value, or have a default value



subject.new_record?
=> true -> this tells us that the new object is created but not saved
=> false -> this tells us that the new object is not created because it existed already in our db

----------------------
Set values/attributes
-----------------------
subject.name = "First Subject" -> we write the object, then the attribute we want to add then equals and the value.

the attributes exists in our db and these are created from the columns that we have set in migrations

Mass assignement attributes
if we have many attributes we can set them all together, using hashes, like that:
subject = Subject.new(:name => "First Subject", :position => 1, :visible => true)

------------
Save
------------
To save returns true or false

subject.save => αποθηκεύω το object

 subject.new_record?
=> false

subject.id -> θα δωσει την id value


SECOND METHOD
---------------
Create
---------------

Create returns the object

Instantiate object, set values, save

name of new variable = class name.new(set attributes)

subject = Subject.create(:name=> "Second Subject", :position => 2)

#<Subject id: 2, name: "Second Subject", posistion: 2, visible: false, created_at: "2014-07-10 13:00:34", updated_at: "2014-07-10 13:00:34">
