MASS ASSIGNMENT AND STRONG PARAMETERS



Mass assignment -> we can pass a hash of values to an object to be assigned as attributes

Primary methods that do this are

new
Subject.new(params[:subject])

create
Subject.create(params[:subject])

update
Subject.update_at(params[:subject])



Simple one-to-one assignment:

subject = Subject.new
subject.name = "Dajia"
subject.position = 8
subject.visible = true

Mass assignment:

subject = Subject.new({:name => "Dajia", :position => 1, :visible => true})
BUT this occurs security issues


Blacklisting for assignment -> everythink is available/allowed by default -> no security

Whitelisting for assignment -> everythink is not available/disallowed by default

Blacklisting and Whitelisting could turn on or off whith a simple configuration


Strong Parameters:
So rails 4 uses strong parameters that can not be turn on or off with a configuration. The are on by default (means that all attributes are disallowed by default). All values are unavailable, so we must specify the values that we want to be available.

For set attributes to be allowed for mass assignment, we use the .permit

For defining them in rails we use .permit()

also strong parameters gives us .require. Το .require διασφαλιζει οτι η παραμετρος υπάρχει

params.require(:subject).permit(:name, :position, :visible)
